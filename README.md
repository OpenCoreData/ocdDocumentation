# Open Core Data Documentation

## About
This repository is the start of moving the documentation for Open Core to an open git repository.
This will allow feedback by git issues and the tracking of their resolution.  It will 
also provide a more maintainable location for the documents that integrates with the 
other work hosted here.


### Main documents
* [Open Core](./OpenCore.md) 
* [Architecture](./Architecture.md)


### ToDo and current events in development

- [ ] Services for generating datacite 4.0 documents 
- [ ] Finish migration of remaining RDF datacite
- [ ] KML "microservice" (not really a microservice)
