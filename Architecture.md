# Open Care Data Architecture

### Design 

### Decisions

(http 2.0) docker, go, apis and semantics etc. etc.

### Git repositories

### Other

##### Web Components

A set of web components is being developed as part of the GeoLink effort.  These web component have direct use in OCD and also demonstrate an approach that will make the maintenance of the web interface easier in the future by allow a “modular approach” to the pages.  Work on components can be found at

##### Data publishing notes

Need to review http://www.copdess.org/ COPDESS and also the EC Council of Data Facilities.  Also the ESIP Fed data publishing guidelines.  
Look over http://wiki.tdwg.org/twiki/bin/view/DarwinCore/PaleontologyElement (Paleo Darwin Core, ADBC, etc)  (there is no paleo extension anymore..  it’s part of the core)
BCO (https://github.com/tucotuco/bco) and DarwinCore have a very similar relation to each other as the ODP’s and Views have in GeoLink.   
Focus on the sample (thing) with IGSN and the metadata with that.  Then hang your data off that with simple URI’s.
