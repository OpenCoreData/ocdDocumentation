### Community connections

In order to enhance the impact of scientific drilling and core data, opencoredata.org will work with domain-specific data management efforts to ensure that drilling results can be easily discovered and harvested by these external systems. This will allow specific subsets of IODP and CSDCO data (e.g. paleobiology, geochemistry, sedimentology, paleomagnetics, etc.) to gain visibility in domain-specific data systems serving their communities of scientists, including many who are not traditional users of drilling data, and integrate the results of scientific drilling projects with relevant related data for enhanced analysis and cross-disciplinary research.
