# Open Core Data Documentation

## About
This repository is the start of moving the documentation for Open Core to an open git repository.
This will allow feedback by git issues and the tracking of their resolution.  It will 
also provide a more maintainable location for the documents that integrates with the 
other work hosted here.


### Main documents
* [Open Core](./OpenCore.md)  This is the main document at this time.
* [Architecture](./Architecture.md)  This document is only a skelton version


### Things coming soon...

- [ ] Free text indexing of RDF resources
- [ ] Services for generating datacite 4.0 documents in order to register resources for DOI's 
via EZID ref: [ocdGarden ezidClient](https://github.com/OpenCoreData/ocdGarden/tree/master/ezidClient)
- [ ] Finish RDF publishing and pushing them out via VoID.  
- [ ] KML "microservice" (not really a microservice) to build out some extra geospatial options
- [ ] Jypiter notebook updates to include in some new API's in the examples
